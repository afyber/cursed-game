# Stuff That Needs Doing

## Bugs and Breaking issues

- [ ] Write frame-drawing functions to replace `tcod::print_frame`

## Required Features for Initial Relase

By order of importance
- [ ] Full item system with weapons, armor, potions, scrolls:
Some items can be weilded, but some are single-use
- [ ] Ranged weapon/magic casting system
- [ ] Random Level Generation:
templates, based on the purpose of a floor (one could be a guard room, or a dungeon, etc.)
- [ ] Multiple enemy AI's:
various types of enemy AI for different monsters and abilities
- [ ] Custom sprites/tiles
- [ ] Animation system:
make the message which is associated with an animation flash at the same time and with the same color as the animation on the map
- [ ] Sound effects:
would really make the game stand out and be easier to understand for players new to roguelikes

## Would be Cool

In no particular order
- [ ] Dialogue/a story beyond the basic one
- [ ] ASCII character portraits
- [ ] Main menu/death text animation
- [ ] Music
